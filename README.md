# Audio-Equalizer
This program works as a equalizer using digital FIR and IIR filters, in addition to visual signal representation in time and frequency domains.
The	program	has	the	functionality	to	filter	the	given	bands:
(0-170	Hz)	-(	170-310Hz)	-(	310-600	Hz)-(	600-1000	Hz)	-(	1-3	KHz)-
(	3-6	KHz)	-(	6-12KHz)	-(	12-14KHz)	-(	14-16KHz)		
Using	FIR filters	and	IIR	filters	with ability also to change	the	gains	applied	on any	band.
Additionally,	2	possible representations are available (Time domain	representation)	and	(Frequency domain	representation).
Moreover,	impulse, step, and frequency responses in	addition to	zeros	and	poles	of each	filter are available to	be shown when	needed.
Check the report uploaded in the repository for more information and figures.
